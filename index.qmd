# Everything I do!
A compilation of everything I am involved with! This includes academics and school/career related activites, and also just things I do in my free time!

[![My Awesome Project](/images/headphones.jpg)](/projects/music/)

Welcome to my website. This is a Quarto-generated page.

# These are my ideas for what I can include on this website. I want to make it like an interactable LinkedIn but including everything I'm involved in, not just academics.
1. Music - Soundcloud profile, any projects I'm currently working on
2. this website - meta asf
3. research - TIES. all projects I've worked on in TIES so first the compilation of the EDA data, the verification of everything, 
etc. so like i am envisioning there's a square image with the TIES logo or wtv and i click on it and then i can see
all the different things I was involved in with TIES. pictures if there are any (ex: the SAA conference, even tho I'm
not gonna be there having a picture of the poster would be sick). that's the second thing so far is the poster.
future: any other research labs
4. volunteering - crisis text line, reading aces, CPS, etc
5. sports & gym stuff - weight loss journey, journey with my knees/hips and flexibility, stretching, etc, 
6. RUNNING - any events i run (ex: longhorn run) or anything related to RUNNING
7. Agemates & my involvement with them 
update this list constantly...
